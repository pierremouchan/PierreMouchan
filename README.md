# Hey ! ðŸ‘‹

---

Formerly a startup founder, I've tried to **build a perfect product to help companies worldwide.** âœ¨

Then, in November 2021, we suddenly crash... ðŸ¤¯

I decided I was going to *learn from my mistakes those past 2 years.* ðŸ¤”

My new resolution was to **help businesses**,
by helping them grow healthy and by developing an ideal and memorable identity. 

Since that day, I've spent my time building many opportunities for companies. ðŸ“ˆ

Combined with my former skills as a multidisciplinary freelancer,
my mission is to help them deliver a great experience for their users. ðŸš€

**TODAY:**

â†’ I've helped digital agencies in New York and Europe build creative websites for their clients
â†’ I've produced augmented reality filters in collaboration with Facebook for a Swiss Company
â†’ I've started teaching some classes to different people around the world
â†’ I am coaching and helping startups in their product and brand development in Paris (Station F)
â†’ I've created my full startup brand, leveraging the full power of branding and design to convince people, 
    reflect our values and create a 'premium' feeling

â†’ I've learned from my mistakes, taking into consideration every bad step that we took to build our 
    startup

**THE RESULTS?**

â†’ Winning some awards, rewarding both the client and the digital agency with significant numbers of 
    views and new business opportunities.
â†’ By leveraging AR filters, +20% sells during Black Friday for the company that I worked for with the help 
    of Facebook
â†’ 2 years creating a startup: the greatest opportunity and experience of my career: knowing how to fail 
    and learning the business side - Since then, I know how to guide a startup to success
